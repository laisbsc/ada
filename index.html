            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are the parents of Ada, the friendly chatbot. We decided to build Ada out of the perception that all
              people feel comfortable sharing feelings and real moods with humans. Ada is a friendly chatbot that wants
            to help you getting through loneliness.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Ada was built out of necessity, as a graduation project. Beyond that, her mission is to help humans become
          more aware of their feelings and underlying emotional states. Throughout time, Ada intents to help you perceive
          how true is the impression of <i>loneliness</i>.</p>
